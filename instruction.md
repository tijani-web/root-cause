Agentic Workflows
Hackathon
Choose a problem worth solving and use agents to create
something people would genuinely find useful.
Welcome
Welcome to the micro1 Agentic Workflows
Hackathon. Choose a problem worth solving and
use agents to create something people would genuinely find useful. Keep it practical, share what you
learn and have fun.
Your challenge
Pick a specific and meaningful problem you understand. Use agents to solve it and show through clear
evidence that your solution improves the way the
task is handled today.
Start by explaining who has the problem. Describe
the bottleneck they face and why solving it would be
valuable in practice. The goal is to create something
a real person would want to use.

How agents can help
Use whichever agent capabilities help solve the
problem well. One solution may improve when the
agent receives better context or better tools.
Another may use memory to carry important information forward. Verification can catch errors before
they reach the user, while specialized skills can
deepen the agent’s ability in a particular task. Some
solutions may benefit from orchestration across several agents.
Choose the approach that fits your problem. Judges
focus on whether each design choice improves the
solution and helps the agent reach the goal reliably.
Purposeful choices matter more than the number
of components.
Show how the solution improved
Create a simple baseline that represents a reasonable basic way to handle the task
before using your solution. For example:
One direct prompt with basic
instructions.
One general purpose agent with
basic tools.
A simple script or template. The manual process people use
today.
Keep the comparison fair by giving the baseline and
final solution the same task and evaluation cases.
Explain any meaningful difference in the resources
available to each one.
Use the final baseline comparison to show the size of
the overall improvement. Use the changelog to explain where that improvement came from. Together,
they tell the complete story of your solution.

Tellthe story with an improvement changelog
Create a short changelog that tells the story of how
your solution evolved. Start with the simple
baseline and follow the journey through to the final
result. This makes it clear how each meaningful
change contributed.
Add one entry for every important experiment.
Explain what you tried and why you tried it. Then
show the result using the same evaluation method
whenever possible and share what you decided to do
next. Include experiments you later removed and explain what they taught you about the problem.

How to evaluate your solution
Choose one primary metric that reflects what success means to the user. For a developer, that might
be how many tests pass. An operations team may
care more about saving time or reducing cost, while
a forecasting team may focus on calibration. Pick the
measure that best captures the improvement your
solution promises.
Before running the evaluation, define what a good final result looks like for the intended user. Use the
same cases for the baseline and final solution, then
share the complete results. Ten or more cases is a
good target when the task allows it. Include one
challenging case and explain what it revealed.

Problem & User Value 15 A strong project solves a meaningful problem for a clearly defined user.
Ask yourself: Who experiences the bottleneck and why does solving it matter?
Agent Solution &
Engineering
30 A strong solution uses agents purposefully and is technically sound. Better context or
tools may improve one project, while memory, verification, skills or orchestration may
improve another.
Ask yourself: Which design choices helped the agent solve the problem?
End to End Quality 20 A strong solution completes a realistic and self contained execution and produces a
final result the user can use, with the finish of something a person would sign their
name to rather than an obvious AI generated draft.
Ask yourself: Would the intended user consider this output high quality, or does it
read as clearly AI generated?
Measured
Improvement
15 A strong report demonstrates gains over a fair baseline and uses the changelog to
connect each iteration with evidence.
Ask yourself: Which changes truly improved the outcome?
Reproducibility 15 A reproducible project gives another person a clear path to run the solution and
baseline and reach the main result.
Ask yourself: Could they do it from a clean environment?
Hot Take / Insights 5 A strong insight turns an observed failure mode into a practical lesson for building
more reliable agents.
Ask yourself: What did you learn and how would it change what you build next?

Ground rules
These rules are baseline requirements for every eligible project.
01 You are welcome to build with tools and components you already know.
02 Make it clear what existed before the competition and what you added.
03 Use every tool and component according to its license and service terms.
04 Keep consequential actions controlled through a sandbox or simulation. Add human approval before
the action happens.
05 Make a qualified human reviewer part of any solution that could significantly affect someone.
06 Choose a legal and ethical use case that treats people and their data responsibly.
07 Use information you are allowed to share. Public or synthetic data are usually the easiest options.
Approved anonymous data also works.
08 Keep credentials and private information outside the submission.
09 Connect every claim about your results to the evidence you submit.
10 Give judges enough access to run the project and reproduce the main result.

Final deliverables
Submit your deliverable with these four items.
01
Complete solution code and improvement changelog
Share the full project and everything required to run it. Include the code as well as the instructions that
shape each agent. Use the README to introduce the intended user and explain their current bottleneck. Then describe why solving it is valuable. Add a clearly labeled Improvement Changelog using the
structure above. Give every meaningful iteration its own entry and connect it to the evidence that
guided your next decision. Close with the main failure mode and your hot take.
02 Reproduction guide
Write for someone starting from a clean environment. Walk them through setup and provide the exact
commands for the solution, baseline and evaluation. Explain which data is required and what output to
expect. Share the relevant versions along with the approximate runtime and cost.
03 Solution video
Submit a video of up to [5 minutes]. Begin with the problem and simple baseline, then walk through
one realistic execution from start to finish. Show the final comparison and briefly explain the
changelog. Highlight the change that contributed most as well as one experiment you removed.
04 Agent trajectories
Include representative trajectories for every agent you used. Make each trajectory easy to follow from
the agent instructions to the final result. Show what the agent did and how its tools responded.
Capture the feedback that shaped its next step as well as any retries or human checkpoints.

Code analysis: is this repository actually good?
01 Who has this problem? One possible scenario could be a team considering the purchase of a private repository and they need to know what the
code is worth. Since they did not build it, there must be a way to
reliably sense its quality before agreeing on a fair price.
02 What bottleneck makes it
worth solving?
If you think in a code repository, a README file or working
demo reveals little about the quality of the actual code. The
buyer must understand an unfamiliar codebase, also run the
build and tests, inspect the architecture and dependencies and
assess technical debt and maintenance risks. There is also relevant evidence in pull requests or open issues and reviewers
may interpret the same signals differently. If you don’t have a
repeatable method, the valuation can depend on an incomplete or inconsistent judgment.
03 Does the agent solve it well? A useful system could analyze the repository and give the
buyer a clear quality assessment before they negotiate the
price. The team still has to define what “good” means and how
code quality should influence the valuation. One way to test it is
to have qualified reviewers rank ten approved codebases with a
shared rubric, then give the same codebases and rubric to
the agent and to a simple baseline. Does the agent come
closer to the reviewers’ order, and can it explain each position
with evidence?
04 Can another person
reproduce the result?
Use approved repositories and document the exact setup,
commands, tool versions and expected output for both the
baseline and the agent. Tie every score to a file, test result
or build output. A second person starting from a clean
environment should be able to run the workflow on the same
codebases and reproduce the assessment and relative ranking.

Candidate evaluation:
should we hire this person?
01 Who has this problem? Think on recruiters and hiring managers that need to decide
whether a candidate is right for a role. The evidence they
need is spread across the job description, the target
profile, the candidate’s CV, interview records and any
completed assessments.
02 What bottleneck makes it
worth solving?
If you are actually reviewing each source in isolation, it is pretty
easy to miss contradictions or give one signal too much weight.
A candidate may look perfect at the beginning even when the
evidence does not fully line up. Even more, if you are actually
suspecting the candidate cheated then it makes the decision
more sensitive because a warning sign alone is not proof of it.
03 Does the agent solve it well? Potentially, an agent could bring the evidence into one review,
connect job requirements to demonstrated skills, check stated
experience against approved sources and explain any discrepancies. The actual recommendation should make its evidence
and uncertainty visible while leaving the final decision to a
qualified reviewer.
04 Can another person
reproduce the result?
You can use approved or synthetic candidate cases so the
evaluation does not depend on private information. Run the
baseline and the agent on the same cases including one candidate with conflicting signals. Report every result, including failures, and trace each score or concern back to its source. A
second reviewer should be able to reproduce the assessment
from the same material without big discrepancies or changes
on the resolution.

Podcasttranslation: can every
version still feel like the same show?
01 Who has this problem? Think on podcast creators and teams that are responsible for
how a show sounds in every language. Basically, each translated episode must remain consistent with the episodes that
came before it.
02 What bottleneck makes it
worth solving?
The big problem is context can span hours of audio, multiple
speakers, earlier episodes and prior translation choices. One
episode may sound fine in isolation while inconsistencies accumulate across the series. Some challenges this could have is
something like a speaker’s name may be pronounced differently, a recurring phrase may be translated differently from one
episode to the next or a joke may lose its meaning because an
earlier reference was handled another way. Each sentence can
be correct while the series as a whole no longer feels coherent.
03 Does the agent solve it well? A strong solution would translate across episodes and languages while keeping speaker identity, pronunciation, recurring terms, tone and prior decisions consistent over all of it.
Whether it produces transcripts, subtitles or dubbed audio the
result should preserve the meaning and timing of the original
while sounding natural in the target language.
04 Can another person
reproduce the result?
It is important to define the evaluation before running it.
Choose a fixed set of episodes and target languages then use
the same inputs for the baseline and the agent. Include one
case that depends on a recurring detail. Each translation
choice should point back to the source audio or approved material, such as show notes or a glossary. Anyone should be able
to rerun the evaluation and check the result.
